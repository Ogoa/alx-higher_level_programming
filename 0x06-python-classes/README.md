This directory contains files for tasks done under the `0x06.Python - Classes and Objects` project.<br>
Every subsequent module builds on the previous one.<br>

<br>`0-square.py`<br>
Defines an empty class `Square` that defines a square.


<br>`1-square.py`<br>
Defines a class `Square` with a private instance attibute `size`.


<br>`2-square.py`<br>
Instantiation with optional `size: def __init__(self, size=0):`, where `size` must be an integer, otherwise exceptions are raised.


<br>`3-square.py`<br>
Adds a method, `def area(self)`, that calculates the area of the square.


<br>`4-square.py`<br>
Adds getter and setter methods to retrieve and update the private instance field `size`.


<br>`5-square.py`<br>
Adds a class method that prints in stdout, the square with the character `#`. If `size` is equal to 0, it prints an empty line.


<br>`6-square.py`<br>
Adds a private instance field, `position`, that also has its getter and setter method. It specifies the coordinates of a square and how it will be printed.
