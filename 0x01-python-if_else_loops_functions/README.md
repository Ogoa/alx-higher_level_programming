`7-islower.py`<br>
Function that checks for a lowercase character. It returns `True` if the argument is a lowercase character otherwise `False`.

`8-uppercase.py`<br>

Prototype:
```
def print_last_digit(number):
```

`10-add.py`<br>
Function that adds two integers and returns the result.
```
def add(a, b):
```

`11-pow.py`<br>
Function that computes `a` to the power of `b` and returns the value.
```
def pow(a, b):
```


`12-fizzbuzz.py`<br>
Function that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 separated by a space. For multiples of three print `Fizz` instead of the number and for multiples of five print `Buzz`. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print `FizzBuzz`.<br>
Each element should be followed by a space.
